To run these appliactions, download them (install pytorch if needed), and run the following inside the appliaction folder:

```bash
python interactive.py
```

Note: For demo_registration and demo_headsame, the provided code examples do not include image data due to data-sharing restrictions. Users need to use their own image data to run these two applications. All other applications use public data, which are included at the link above.
